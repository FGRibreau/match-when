### match-when - Pattern matching for modern JavaScript [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/FGRibreau/match-when/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/FGRibreau/match-when/tree/master)

Adding pattern matching to JavaScript (ES6+) through two new special *keywords*\* `match` and `when`. The main goals are **safety** and **shortness**.
There is a lot more to do but after some late work, that's all for tonight!

#### Usage

The setup is pretty simple, simply require the library with `match` and `when` and you are ready to go!

```js
const {match, when} = require('match-when');
```

or globally

```js
require('match-when/register'); // `match` and `when` are now globally available
```

Now let's see how we would write a factorial function:

```js
function fact(n){
  return match({
    [when(0)]: 1,
    [when()]: (n) => n * fact(n-1)
  })(n);
}

fact(10); // 3628800
```

Clear and simple right?

</p>

Note that `when()` is a catch-all pattern and should always be the last condition. If you forget it `match()` will throw a `MissingCatchAllPattern` exception.

##### High Order Functions

`match` works well with high order functions like `map`, `filter` (and so on) too:

```js
[2, 4, 1, 2].map(match({
  [when(1)]: "one",
  [when(2)]: "two",
  [when()]: "many"
}));

// [ 'two', 'many', 'one', 'two' ]
```

##### Arrays


It also works with **arrays**:

```js
function length(list){
  return match({
    [when([])]: 0,
    [when()]: ([head, ...tail]) => 1 + length(tail)
  })(list);
}

length([1, 1, 1]); // 3
```

##### OR

Sadly JavaScript does not offer us a way to overload operators so we're stuck with `when.or`:

```js
function parseArgument(arg){
  return match({
    [when.or("-h", "--help")]: () => displayHelp,
    [when.or("-v", "--version")]: () => displayVersion,
    [when()]: (whatever) => unknownArgument.bind(null, whatever)
  })(arg);
}

parseArgument(process.argv.slice(1)); // displayHelp || displayVersion ||Â (binded)unknownArgument
```

### Supported patterns:


- `{ x1: pattern1, ..., xn: patternn }` - matches any object with property names `x1` to `xn` matching patterns `pattern1` to `patternn`, respectively. Only the own properties of the pattern are used.
- `[pattern0, ..., patternn]` - matches any object with property names 0 to n matching patterns `pattern0` to `patternn`, respectively.
- `when.or(pattern0, pattern1, ...)` - matches if one `pattern` matches.

### Todo:

I will accept PR with their associated tests for the following features:

- `match.and(pattern, ...)` - matches if every pattern matches.
- support `range(x, y)`
- try and maybe support `match(input, {patterns...})` syntax instead of `match({patterns...})(input)`?

[todo-list inspired by pattern-match from dherman](https://github.com/dherman/pattern-match#patterns).

\* *well, of course, they are not keywords but simple functions*

</p>

I work at [iAdvize](iadvize.com) as a Lead Developer and Architect. iAdvize is the leading real-time customer engagement platform in Europe and is used in 40 different countries. We are one of the french startup with the [fastest growth](http://www.iadvize.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/11/CP-Fast-50.pdf) and one of [the **greatest place to work** in **France**](https://vimeo.com/122438055).

We are looking for a [NodeJS backend developer](http://smrtr.io/FqP79g), a [Scala backend developer](http://smrtr.io/FqP79g), a [JavaScript frontend developer](http://smrtr.io/wR-y4Q), a [Full-stack Developer](http://smrtr.io/SGhrew) and a [DevOps System Engineer](http://smrtr.io/OIFFMQ) in Paris or Nantes. **[Send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/FGRibreau) if you have any questions**!

## The Story

I was working on an internal tool at iAdvize [during our hack days (fr)](http://www.iadvize.com/blog/fr/product-swarms-organisation-parfaite/). This tool is representing our micro-service architecture and every of its components in a near real-time graph (I may open-source it in the future).

Somewhere in the graph relationship code I thought wait a minute, would it be awesome to use some pattern-matching there? So I tried to write some syntax that could exist for it...

```js
SyntaxError: /Users/FG/www/iadvize-services-orchestration-tools/src/api/src/repositoryManagers/github.js: Unexpected token (185:32)
  183 |
  184 |           _.flatten(links).forEach(link => {
> 185 |             [{protocol: 'HTTP'}]: => 1,
      |                                 ^
  186 |             [{protocol: 'AMQP'}]: => 2
  187 |           });
  188 |
```

... and of course it failed.

It was 6PM so the good news was I would have all the time I wanted to see if it could be possible to implement a pattern-matching solution that was both **syntaxically short**, would work well with **functional**-style code while using JavaScript ES6 features for conciseness.

I ended up with this syntax:

```js
[2, 4, 1, 2].map(match({
  [when(1)]: "one",
  [when(2)]: "two",
  [when()]: "many"
}));

// [ 'two', 'many', 'one', 'two' ]
```

Which works also that way:

```js
function length(list){
  return match({
    [when([])]: 0,
    [when()]: ([head, ...tail]) => 1 + length(tail)
  })(list);
}

length([1, 1, 1]); // 3
```

Underneath it uses [enhanced object literals](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#enhanced-object-literals), [symbols](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#symbols) and, sadly, JSON serialization/deserialization to pass object properties.
